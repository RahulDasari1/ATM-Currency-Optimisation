## **Installation & Usage**
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ATM-Currency-Optimization.git
   ```
   Or manually download the files and extract them.

2. **Ensure all files are in the same directory**  
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `image.png`

3. **Open `index.html` in a browser**  
   Just double-click the `index.html` file to launch the ATM interface.

## **How It Works**
1. Enter the amount you want to withdraw in the input box.
2. Click the **"Calculate"** button.
3. The system will determine the optimal number of notes based on available denominations (2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10).
4. The breakdown of notes will be displayed on the screen.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5** - Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3** - Styling and positioning of elements.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** - Logic for note calculation.

---

## **Customization**
- You can modify the **denominations** in `script.js` to include/exclude currency notes.
- The **background image** (`image.png`) can be replaced with a different ATM screen design.
- Adjust the CSS styles (`styles.css`) to modify layout, colors, and text.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a **PIN authentication screen** for a more realistic ATM experience.
- Implement a **database** to track available cash in the ATM.
- Introduce **sound effects** for button clicks and cash dispensing.
